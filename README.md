## The idea of this project :

To build this project I had to understand the difference between the class components and functional components and organizing my files with use of destructuring - 

`Rending in React is extremely important to understand`
`React will read the contructor class before rendering `
`React then will render`
`After rendering React will go through the DidMount` 

## Available Scripts
